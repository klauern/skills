description: Continue working on in-progress markdown notebooks and plans
---

List out the .md files and review them to identify any that are considered working notebooks and plans for future work.  If there are, spec out the next steps and continue working on completing items in them.  When completing something, update that notebook withe latest status.

Similarly, if our last commands failed due to API key timeouts or retry errors, continue working on the last steps we were working on before tackling anything new.
